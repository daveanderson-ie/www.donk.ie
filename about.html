        <p class="lead">
          Ever since I can remember, I've hated filling in forms.
        </p>
        <P>
          It always seemed ... wrong. Especially when I'd been paying a company for years, and they ask
          me for basic information that they *must* already have.
        </P>
        <P>
          And then when you want to switch to another company, there's more forms. And a new web portal.
          Another password. More forms. And a direct debit that *always* seems to take money at the worst
          possible time of the month.
        </P>
        <P>I also like a deal. Why would I pay more, when another company has a discount? But it's pretty
          time-consuming and after I've found a great deal, so begins The Filling In Of The Forms.</P>
        <P>So, I decided to fix it. And if it works for me, why not you?</P>

        <P>
          I created <strong>donk</strong> to take the donkey work out of bills and switching.
          At the start, it's just a way to look after lots of bills in one place. But then, there are lots
          of interesting things that can happen:
        </P>
        <ul>
            <LI>We'll manage your direct debits, you pay with a card. This makes it much easier to switch,
              and if you switch banks, you just update your card details and *boom* you're done.</LI>
            <LI>Most companies bill according to their schedule. Wouldn't it be better to choose what day of
              the month is most convenient for you? Want to pay weekly? Sure, why not.
            </LI>
            <LI>Who's got time to search for new deals, read the fine print, for all your bills? We do! If you
              want, we'll even make recommendations to switch. To switch, all you'd have to do is say 'ok'.
            </LI>
            <LI>Got a problem with one of your bills, or the company's acting the maggot? Get ready to spend hours googling
              forums and trying to ring their call centre. Or, connect with an expert who knows exactly how that company works,
              and get your problem solved quickly.
            </LI>
          </ul>
